# SocketProject
Currently building a network infrastructure using Python, Linux Virtual Machines, and Apache Web Servers that allows clients to play multiple simultaneous games of “Six Card Golf” with each other. These client processes communicate with each other using sockets that utilize both client-server and peer-to-peer technologies.
